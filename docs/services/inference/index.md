# Inference

!!! under-construction "Inference services are in beta"
    Inference services are under development.
    We are seeking additional novel use cases, to help shape the service design.
    Please contact Stefano Schuppli at [`stefano.schuppli@cscs.ch`](mailto:stefano.schuppli@cscs.ch) and Pablo Fernandez at [`pablo.fernandez@cscs.ch`](mailto:pablo.fernandez@cscs.ch) if you are interested.

Inference services leverage Machine Learning models to generate new content based on a given input. We enable the deployment of models and related services without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

-   :fontawesome-solid-layer-group: __Managed Model Access__

    Managed, Internet-accessible [OpenAI](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs)/[Anthropic](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/overview)-compatible inference APIs providing open-weight models (e.g., [Apertus](https://apertvs.ai/)), with token-based resource consumption.

-   :fontawesome-solid-layer-group: __Custom Inference Service__

    Designed for users who need to develop and operate ML-centric services (e.g., RAG) and use cases beyond LLMs.

    Internet-accessible Kubernetes namespaces backed by mixed hardware resources, combining Grace-Hopper GPU nodes with commodity CPU-only virtual machines.
    Resource consumption is based on assigned CPU, GPU, memory, and storage.

    !!! under-construction
        This service is not yet available for early testing.

<!-- removed because the name "blueprints for re-deployments" is ambiguous, and because we do not have any good internal documentation about this feature.
-   :fontawesome-solid-layer-group: __Blueprints for re-deployments__ 

    Deployment-ready blueprints for re-creating the GPU Hybrid Namespaces model on segregated infrastructure where stronger privacy, confidentiality, or compliance controls are required.
    They preserve the same flexibility for custom ML-centric services, resource-based consumption, and mixed-hardware Kubernetes operations, while adapting the platform to stricter isolation boundaries.

    !!! under-construction
        This service is not yet available.
